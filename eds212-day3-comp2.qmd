## Vectors in R

```{r}
# every element in a vector has to be in the same class
marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow", TRUE)

# all elements above have become a character
class(marmots)
```

Create a numeric vector:

```{r}
pika <- c(12.4, 6.8, 2.9, 8.8, 5)

# when data visualization is not what you're expecting, check class of data
# usually check in console
class(pika)
```

Create integer values:

```{r}
bear <- c(2L, 3L, 5L, 18L)
```
